# CSE Student Portal

## Overview

The CSE Student Portal is a comprehensive educational management system for Kameshwar Narayan Singh Govt Polytechnic College's Computer Science Engineering department. The application enables administrators to manage student records, attendance, marks, and library resources, while students can view their academic progress and library information through dedicated dashboards.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- React with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- Shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- Recharts for data visualization with interactive charts:
  - **Admin Dashboard Charts:**
    - AttendanceOverviewChart: Line chart showing monthly attendance trends (present vs absent)
    - MarksDistributionChart: Bar chart displaying marks distribution across ranges
    - SubjectPerformanceChart: Bar chart showing average performance by subject
    - LibraryStatisticsChart: Pie chart with book availability overview
  - **Student Dashboard Charts:**
    - AttendanceChart: Personal attendance trends
    - MarksChart: Individual performance visualization

**Design System:**
- **Modern Color Palette (October 2025):** Purple/violet theme (262 hue) for primary colors, replacing previous blue theme
  - Light mode: Clean backgrounds (220 20% 97%) with subtle purple accents
  - Dark mode: Professional dark backgrounds (240 10% 8%) with vibrant purple highlights
  - Primary color: 262 83% 58% (light) / 262 80% 65% (dark)
- **Custom Gradient Effects:** 
  - `gradient-text`: Purple-to-pink gradient text for headers
  - `gradient-bg`: Subtle purple gradient backgrounds
  - `glass-effect`: Frosted glass effect with backdrop blur
  - `modern-card`: Enhanced card styling with hover effects
- **Smooth Animations System:**
  - `fade-in`: Smooth opacity entrance animation
  - `slide-up`: Upward slide with fade-in effect
  - `scale-in`: Scale entrance animation
  - `hover-lift`: Smooth lift effect on hover (translateY + shadow)
  - `smooth-transition`: Cubic-bezier easing for all transitions
  - **Important:** No scale transforms on interactive elements (buttons, inputs) to avoid layout shifts
  - Staggered animations for dashboard cards (0.1s, 0.2s, 0.3s, 0.4s delays)
- Dual theme support (light/dark mode) with CSS custom properties
- Consistent spacing and typography using Inter font family
- Component variants using class-variance-authority for maintainable styling
- Elevation system for hover and active states
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design:** Full-width buttons on mobile (w-full sm:w-auto), adaptive spacing (p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8)

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Role-based UI rendering: Separate dashboard components for admin and student views
- Client-side routing handled within App.tsx component switching
- Form validation using react-hook-form with Zod schema resolvers
- Optimistic UI updates with React Query mutations
- Session-based authentication state management

**Performance Optimization:**
- React Query configured with `staleTime: Infinity` globally for instant cached data loads
- Student-specific data cached with studentId in query keys for proper isolation
- No forced refetches on mount - data loads instantly from cache when available
- Background refetches only when cache is invalidated by mutations
- Zero loading delays for cached data, providing instant dashboard navigation
